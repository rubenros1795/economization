# Code for "Studying Parliamentary Economization using Topic Burstiness and Entropy"
_Presented at DH2023, Graz_

## Goal of the paper
Historians and economists speak of processes of "economization"; the rephrasal or redefinition of things as economic. This process is associated with the late twentieth century. For my research on technocratic reasoning, economization appears as an interesting concept because it offers a more specific lens on the way politics is curtailed by scientific considerations. In this paper, I assess whether signals of economization can be found in parliamentary debates. I use topic models to divide my corpus in thematic layers. I then investigate the relations between those layers to see whether economic topics/layers appears as more relevant over time.

## Method
I use entropy and burstiness as metrics to study economization. Read more about them in the abstract.

## Wider relevance
I think this paper offers opportunities to investigate other forms of semantic or topical linkage, infection and redefinition. The methods I use pertain to forms of structural discursive transformations, beyond the level of single concepts.
